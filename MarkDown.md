- this if you needed normal style
  ```
  const containerStyle = {
    display: "flex",
  };
  <div style={containerStyle}>
  ```

# _problems Solved_

1.  > the overflow: hidden; property is added to the Parent component. This property prevents margin collapse between the parent and child elements.
    >
    > By using overflow: hidden;, the parent element establishes a new block formatting context, which prevents the margin of the child element from collapsing with the margin of the parent element.
2.  solving the problem of smooth displaying slider by usig to transition function (one for the opacity and one for the transformüôÉ)
    ```
       transition: opacity 1s ${({ sideopen }) => (sideopen ? 'step-start' : 'step-end')};
       transition: transform 200ms ${({ sideopen }) => (sideopen ? 'linear' : 'step-start')}
    ```
3.  if you want to do something with the fetched data by reactQuery outside the return() you have to wrap it in if condition checks if the status=='success' or not as the component renders without the data in the first time (the data takes time be fetched)

# _Notes_

1. - if you know the targeted element after click happens --> select it as global from the beginning using ref (or querySelector if you are using react)
   - if you don't know what the target element use `e.target`
   - if the targeted element is the element that have the click listener itself use `e.currentTarget`

2. <font color="brown">Selecting Styled Component from the Parent Styled Component </font>
   ```css
   const parent = styled.div`
    & ${Child}:nth-of-type(2) { /*select nth regardless of its level of nesting in the parent*/
        background-color: red;
      }
    }`
   ```
3. using `const titleRef = useRef<HTMLInputElement>(null);` it enforces that the ref is specifically intended to reference an `<input>` element and provides type safety when accessing properties or methods of the referenced element.
4. `Promise.reject('error msg')` `Promise.resolve('hello world)` `new Promise(res => setTimeout(resolve,1000))` just resolve don't do any thing
5. `<pre><pre>` symantic element for adding errors
6. we can use `color-gradient` to give the same effect of `box-shadow`
7. <details>
     <summary>good setup for github mark down (needs mention npm)</summary>

      <img src='./render%20entire%20page%20depending%20on%20click%20events.png' width=800px/>
   </details>
9. makeing the button disabled when loading data
   ```html
   <button disabled="{postsQuery.isloading}"></button>
   ```
10. don't forget that the names of `props` is only lower case, i got a problem that the prop does't make effect in the styled componet for an hour without showing any error because i named a `prop` in chamel Caseüò≠üò≠
11. always keep keep a paper and a pen besides you to keep your mind clear of ideas and things to rememberüßò‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüå±üßò‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
12. don't forget to use optional chainging with data comes form APIs (so if error happens don't crash)
